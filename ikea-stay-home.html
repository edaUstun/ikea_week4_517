      IKEA “Stay Home” : The Power of Empathy in Digital Marketing
    </h1>

    <h2>Campaign Summary</h2>

    <p>
      At the beginning of 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic affected the entire world,
      and everyone was forced to stay at home. IKEA was affected by this
      situation and shared its “Stay Home” digital campaign on its Instagram
      accounts with the whole world to motivate everyone. With this campaign,
      IKEA aimed to remind people that “home” is a safe place, going beyond
      simply increasing sales. During this challenging period, IKEA focused on
      sharing messages that brought comfort, health, and peace of mind to
      people, rather than prioritizing sales.

    <h2>I2M Matrix Analysis</h2>

    <h3>1. Website</h3>

    <p>
      The “Stay Home” campaign was only shared on social media platforms. The
      campaign reached wide audiences through sincere and creative content
      shared on Instagram (IKEA, 2020). It was not featured on websites. As a
      result, customers were unable to obtain information about the campaign
      from the website. Although the number of views on the IKEA website
      increased during the Covid-19 pandemic, many people were unable to find
      out about the campaign because it was not published on the campaign
      website.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center">
      <img
        src="images/website_visits.jpg"
        alt="IKEA Stay Home Website"
        style="width: 300px; margin: 20px"
      />
    </div>

    <h3>2. E-mail</h3>
    <p>
      IKEA prepared catalogs about the campaign and sent them to some countries
      via e-newsletters. The catalogs contained games for people to have fun at
      home without getting bored.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center">
      <img
        src="images/ikea_katalog.webp"
        alt="IKEA Stay Home Katalog"
        style="width: 400px; margin: 20px"
      />
    </div>

    <h3>3. Search Engines</h3>
    <p>
      It appears that no clear SEO or SEM strategy was followed during the
      campaign. It was noticed that IKEA's “stay home” content was triggered
      less by users than by the brand itself in Google searches.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Online Advertising</h3>
    <p>
      IKEA aimed to make the campaign naturally accessible to users. This may
      have supported the brand's empathetic approach while limiting digital
      access. However, this choice prevented the campaign from being openly
      accessible on digital platforms. One of the digital platforms, the Google
      Display Network, did not publish this ad. The success of digital marketing
      campaigns depends on the effective use of appropriate communication
      channels (Strauss & Frost, 2014).
    </p>

        alt="IKEA Stay Home Instagram online ads"
        style="width: 400px; margin: 20px"
      />
    </div>

    <h3>5. Sales Promotions</h3>
    <p>
      IKEA has not conducted any discount or promotional activities during this
      campaign. With this communication approach, IKEA has demonstrated a
      value-oriented approach to its users.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Public Relations</h3>
    <p>
      IKEA's campaign during the pandemic was described by the press as
      “exemplary brand behavior.” Powerful brands such as FastCompany and AdWeek
      praised IKEA for this campaign. As a result, IKEA gained more value and
      prestige among consumers through this campaign. According to Fast Company
      (2020), IKEA’s campaign conveyed the stay-at-home message warmly and
      effectively during the pandemic.

        style="width: 300px; margin: 20px"
      />

        alt="FastCompany IKEA FastCompany"
        style="width: 300px; margin: 20px"
      />
    </div>

    <h3>7. News</h3>
    <p>
      With this campaign, IKEA took an approach focused on empathy rather than
      sales, which easily earned it coverage in many international news outlets.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Word of Mouth</h3>
    <p>
      With the increase in social media usage during the Covid period, the
      campaign published on Instagram was liked by users and reposted, creating
      a natural advertising network.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center">
      <img
        src="images/ikea_instapeople.png"
        alt="IKEA Stay Home Instagram People"
        style="width: 550px; margin: 20px"
      />
    </div>

    <h3>9. Popular Culture</h3>
    <p>
      IKEA only shared this campaign on Instagram and did not sign any
      advertising agreements with influencers or celebrities. This may be the
      reason why the campaign did not go completely viral.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Gamification</h3>
    <p>
      Users staying at home launched challenges on social media to make their
      time more enjoyable. IKEA could have gained more engagement on its page by
      launching similar stay-at-home challenges.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center">
      <img
        src="images/ikea_instagram.webp"
        alt="Instagram Ikea"
        style="width: 300px; margin: 20px"
      />
    </div>

    <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses of the Campaign</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Strength Point:</strong> A non-sales-based campaign fostered
        empathy and trust among users.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strength Point:</strong> Even without any social media sharing
        agreements, the campaign was able to generate high likes and shares on
        social media.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Weaknesses Point:</strong> It was not featured on the campaign
        website, and gamification was not used to establish a deeper connection
        with users.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Weaknesses Point:</strong> No agreement has been reached with
        any influencer or television media to generate more engagement.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To increase web engagement, a competition could be organized to evaluate
        photos taken by users under the “stay at home” campaign.
      </li>
      <li>
        Photos or videos shared on social media with the hashtag “#stayathome”
        could be reposted on IKEA's Instagram page to show users that they are
        visible and valued.
      </li>
      <li>
        The campaign could have achieved full viral success by signing
        advertising agreements with celebrities or individuals with brand value.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>My Personal Anecdote</h2>
    <p>
      During the pandemic, I had the opportunity to discover this campaign on
      social media. Many people were sharing the safe and peaceful moments they
      had created in their own homes through this campaign. By reading the text
      they wrote under the shared photos, I better understood that everyone was
      sharing the same process in the same way. I didn't make any purchases
      through this campaign, but I felt more empathy towards many people.
